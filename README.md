# Charity & Volunteer Connection Platform

## üåü Introduction

Many charitable organizations struggle to connect with the right volunteers for their programs. Simultaneously, individuals eager to contribute their time often don't know where to find these opportunities, leading to missed chances for meaningful engagement. Furthermore, the fundraising process for charity programs often faces challenges with transparency and community outreach.

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a platform that directly connects charitable organizations with volunteers, making it easier for them to find each other. Additionally, our platform provides a transparent and reliable system for financial donations, fostering a more sustainable and trustworthy environment for charitable activities.

This project also serves as a valuable learning experience for our team to practice and apply foundational software engineering concepts, including database design, user interface development, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, and to explore new technologies.

## ‚ú® Features

Our platform is designed with three distinct user roles, each with a specialized set of tools to streamline the volunteering and charity management process.
